# Dijkstra-Algorithm-with-Capacity-Constraints
Implementing Dijkstra Algorithm on Capacitated Networks

This repository contains a Python implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm on a capacitated network, allowing us to find shortest-cost paths and send flows from a source to a sink. It also includes a visualization of the network showing flows, capacities, and costs on each edge.
